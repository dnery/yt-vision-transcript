# yt-vision-transcript

A web tool for generating transcripts from YouTube videos containing timestamped moments as images
embedded in the final transcript file.

The purpose is to produce a transcript that completely
encompasses a video's content (i.e. moments that cannot be fully captured by text alone embedded video
frames/images) that can be distributed as a single artifact, ready for true offline ingestion by a
system that can leverage this info, such as a local LLM or any such transcript browser that can display
the encoded frames alongside the text.

**Status:** late [ADR](ADR.md) draft.
